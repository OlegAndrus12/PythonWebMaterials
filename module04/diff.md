| Feature        | **HTTP Server**                                            | **Socket**                                                   |

| **Protocol**   | Uses HTTP (a higher-level protocol)                        | Uses TCP or UDP directly (low-level)                         |
| **Connection** | **Stateless**: each request is independent                 | **Stateful**: connection stays open                          |
| **Use Case**   | Browsing web pages, REST APIs                              | Real-time apps (chat, games, live updates)                   |
| **Data Flow**  | Client sends request → server responds → connection closes | Data can flow both ways, continuously                        |
| **Examples**   | Flask, Express, Django                                     | WebSockets, raw TCP/UDP via `socket` module                  |
| **Built On**   | Often built on top of sockets                              | Is the base layer; HTTP is one of many protocols built on it |


HTTP Server: Like sending a letter—you send it, wait for a reply, and the conversation is over.

Socket: Like a phone call—you can talk back and forth without hanging up.
